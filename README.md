### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
- Hello, I'm a 4th grade student at Ege University Computer Engineering. I have been interested in mobile application development for 2 years. I started with cross platform frameworks. Especially with Flutter, I have developed an application for 2 year. I also made applications with the help of json / rest api. I have experience in Agile/Scrum methodology thanks to my internship experience in Garanti BBVA Technology.

 I have been developing myself in this area with auxiliary courses for the last 6 months due to my interest in native ios mobile development. I know the importance of writing clean code and multi-level architecture. I always try to improve myself in this regard. I have always been a researcher and a curious person for new technologies. I am a fast learner, motivated self-starter, team player with strong communication and problem solving skills.
